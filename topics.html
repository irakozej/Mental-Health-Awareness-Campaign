    <h1>Mental Health Awareness</h1>
    <p>
      Mental health is an important topic that affects us all. It's essential to
      raise awareness and provide support to those in need. This page aims to
      share information and resources related to mental health and well-being.
      What is depression? Depression is one of the most common types of mental
      health conditions and often develops alongside anxiety. Depression can be
      mild and short-lived or severe and long-lasting. Some people are affected
      by depression only once, while others may experience it multiple times.
      Depression can lead to suicide, but this is preventable when appropriate
      support is provided. It’s important to know that much can be done to help
      young people who are thinking about suicide. What causes depression?
      Depression can happen as a reaction to something like abuse, violence in
      school, the death of someone close or family problems like domestic
      violence or family breakdown. Someone might get depressed after being
      stressed for a long time. It can also run in the family. Sometimes we may
      not know why it happens.

    <h2>Why Mental Health Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Mental health is just as crucial as physical health. It impacts our
      thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, influencing our overall quality of
      life. By understanding and addressing mental health issues, we can improve
      our well-being and help others do the same. One in two people who receive
      a diagnosis of leprosy or LF will also be affected by mental health
      problems. Mental health problems are especially high among people who
      develop disabilities as a result of their disease. This includes severe
      depression and anxiety and low self-esteem. We have worked with leprosy
      for nearly one hundred years; time and time again we have observed how
      people’s lives change when they are diagnosed, or even suspect they are
      affected, with leprosy. They can be keenly aware of very real prejudice
      and discrimination, scared of potential disability or what their friends,
      family, and neighbours will think. It is also the same for people affected
      by LF. Add in concerns over education, employment, residential, or even
      relationship consequences and it is easy to see why the numbers of people
      in this situation also suffering from a mental health problem are so high.
      This can be worse in places like Bangladesh, where provision for mental
      health support after a diagnosis can be harder to come by locally. With no
      one to talk to about their condition or fears, this can lead to people
      feeling isolated, taking less interest in self-care, exacerbating the
      physical symptoms and even developing suicidal thoughts. Read Building the
      case for the integration of Mental Health services in leprosy and
      lymphatic filariasis programmes. What we do We work to support the whole
      person, from before, during and after the process of confirming their
      diagnosis. Our programmes are specifically designed to establish and work
      with self-care groups and to improve quality of life and health outcomes
      for the people marginalised by leprosy and lymphatic filariasis.
